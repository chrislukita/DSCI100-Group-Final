    "Music plays a huge role in our experience of the world around us. Daily tasks like walking through campus, completing homework assignments, or simply cooking dinner after a long day, is a lot more enjoable while listening to your favourite song or playlist.\n",

    "For our group project this semester, we decided to work with a dataset called [Spotify Tracks DB](https://tinyurl.com/3dnwcpe2). This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.com and was parsed using Spotify's official API. The dataset has over 230,000 unique observations (tracks) and features 18 relevant variables, each describing a specific qualitative or quantitative characteristic of a track.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our predictive question, we are hoping to determine if specific quantitative characteristics of a track (daceability, energy, duration (ms), and tempo) can help predict a new song's populatiry on Spotify."
