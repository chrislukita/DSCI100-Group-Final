    "Music plays a huge role in our experience of the world around us. Daily tasks like walking through campus, working on homework assignments, or simply cooking dinner after a long day, are a lot more enjoyable while listening to your favourite playlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our group project this semester, we decided to work with a dataset called [Spotify Tracks DB](https://tinyurl.com/3dnwcpe2). This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.com and was parsed using Spotify's official API. The dataset has over 110,000 unique observations (tracks) and features 18 relevant variables, each describing a specific qualitative or quantitative characteristic of a track.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our predictive question, we are asking if specific quantitative characteristics of a track (danceability, energy, tempo) can help predict a new song's popularity on the music streaming service, Spotify.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we acknowledge that there is also an array of qualitative factors that contribute to a song's popularity such as culture, seasonality, and personal preference, and therefore must not be dismissed, these qualitative factors affect a song's popularity following its release (Lee & Lee, 2018). Our analysis, then, offers the opportunity to explore how quantitative variables can potentially play a role in predicting the popularity of a song before its initial release. "

    "\n",
    "Our data analysis will adhere to the following structure and format:\n",
    "- Step #1 - Split the data into a training and testing data, respectively. We'll be careful to use relevant proportions of the total data for each set.\n",
    "- Step #2 - Utilize the vfold_cv function to split our training data for cross-validation.\n",
    "- Step #3 - Develop our KNN recipe using relevant class labels and predictors.\n",
    "- Step #4 - Build our nearest neighbors model specification, ensuring that the neighbors parameter is set to tune().\n",
    "- Step #5 - Create workflow using the recipe and model developed in steps 3 and 4.\n",
    "- Step #6 - Choose an optimal K value from this workflow analysis.\n",
    "- Step #7 - Develop a new model specification using the optimal value for K, and then retrain the classifier using fit.\n",
    "- Step #8 - Evaluate accuracy using the testing data.\n",
    "- Step #9 - Develop some visualizations that summarize our analysis, and draft any documentation required to aid understanding of our processes.\n",

    "As our prediction algorithm will be dealing with quantitative data, a scatterplot will be useful for visualizing the datapoints within our dataset. The scatterplot will have one of the three chosen metrics (danceability, energy, and tempo) on the x-axis and another on the y-axis. Furthermore, we will colour the data points to indicate which songs are considered popular and which ones are not popular."

    "\n",
    "**What do we expect to find?**\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, we expect to find that new songs with higher ratings of danceability, energy, and tempo will likely score higher in popularity compared to songs that have lower ratings in these predictive variables. We are hoping to find patterns within the data that may either support this or suggest other possibilities. However, it will be interesting to dive further into this analysis as it is our hope that our assumptions will be challenged and stretched.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our findings could help artists and producers understand the metrics that make music listeners really connect with a song. Making music is both an art and a science, and we hope that our analysis can provide artists and producers with the potential to uncover insights to help them create new music that will resonate with listeners on Spotify and other streaming services. Our findings also have the potential to be used in combination with marketing strategies whereby marketing teams may want to consider using songs that are predicted to be popular in their advertisements in order to entice consumers even more (Lee & Lee, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What future questions could this lead to?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As this dataset is unique to the listening habits of Spotify users, it would be interesting to compare these results with data from other popular streaming services, like Apple Music, Amazon Music, and Youtube Music, respectively, to see if the metrics reported on these music streaming services provide similar results. There is also oppurtunity to analyze the relationship between song popularity and other quantitative metrics not considered in this project. Furthermore, it may also be interesting to research the role these metrics play in current music production to determine if artists and producers already consider these metrics when creating new songs.
